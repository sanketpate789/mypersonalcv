<!--display properties
    1.inline :- <a>,<span>
    2.block  :- <p>,<h1>
    3.inline-block :- <img> her you and addject both the images in one line and also change the width of it.-->
<!--here the image added is not side by side to h1 as h1 is a block element -->
<!--<h1>sanket Pate </h1>-->
<!--<p><span class="web">web</span> devloper</p>--><!--one problem with span is we cant change the width of span we can do it in block -->
<!--now here the span is a inline display element which means it takes only the required amount of space unlike block elements -->
<!--again the <a> tag <img> is also inline display element -->
<!--now block elements are like heading or <p> elements which will block the path for 
other elements to enter  basically if we put a p tag in the html we cant write anyother thing thing on that line after closing the p tag-->
<!--<img src="images/cloud.png" alt="cloud-img">--><!--as here you can see that both the images are side by side this is inline  -->
<!--<img src="images/mountain.png" alt="mountain-img">-->
<!-- now to display the text inline and aslo change the width we can use inline-block and <img> is a inlie-block element -->

<!--to check this just go to codepen.-->
